bun is a fast and disk space efficient package manager, serving as an alternative to npm, pnpm and yarn.

- Open a command-line terminal (e.g. Terminal, Command Prompt).
- Enter `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash` to install bun on linux.
- Enter `powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"` to insall bun on windows.
- You can install dependencies with bun using `bun i`.

You can reference `package.json` files for available scripts, i.e.

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "bun run build.js",
    "watch": "bun run build.js --watch",
    "format": "bun run biome format --write",
    "lint": "bun run biome lint --write"
}
```

Using the example above `bun run build` will run the build script for the given package.
