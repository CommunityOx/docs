# bun

bun is an all included toolkit for javascript and typescript development, combining nodejs and package manager into one tool.

- Install [bun](https://bun.com/docs/installation).
- Use it similarly to npm or pnpm:
  - `bun install` - to install packages,
  - `bun run <script_name>` - to run your scripts within the `package.json`,
  - `bun build <entrypoint> [...flags]` - manual build command, more information in their [documenation](https://bun.com/docs/bundler)

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "vite",
  "watch": "vite build --watch",
  "build": "tsc && vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview",
  "format": "prettier --write \"./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,css}\""
},
```

Using the example above `bun run build` will run the build script for the given package.<br/>
However just running `bun build` will not work as it will trigger the internal build system.
