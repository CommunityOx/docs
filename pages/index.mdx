# Introduction

Overextended was a small group dedicated to creating open-source resources for FiveM, with a focus on quality, security, performance, and stability. As of April 2025, all Overextended repositories have been archived. Their work, however, lives on through the efforts of the community.

## What is Community Ox?

**Community Ox** is an organization formed to maintain and improve forks of most Overextended resources after the original team archived their work. Our mission is to continue providing free, open-source, high-quality resources for the FiveM community. We focus on maintaining core resources like `ox_lib`, `ox_inventory`, and `ox_core`, as well as reviving unfinished projects such as `ox_inventory_v3`.

Community Ox is led by active contributors and long-time supporters of Overextended:

## Creator Codes

Creator codes allow Tebex stores to share revenue with other creators, giving a discount to the customer at the same time. We make these deals to advertise trusted creators who meet our criteria:

- Resources are highly configurable or, preferably, source-available.
- We trust that customers will be given assistance.
- The creator is a known member of our community.
